This will be the first time this symposium will not be held on location. For this year IBM Austin has graciously provided a room, but it was not to be due to the COVID-19 crisis.\r\n\r\n### Nabble RexxLA forum defunct\r\nThe owner of the Nabble fora has decided to shut it down gradually. Before the forum was deleted, we have saved the messages. RexxLA will announce a new forum shortly, to interact to our mailing list over the Web.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
